1. check why some of the codes like eg:  clean_text are given, all of them are commented in decode.ipynb file
2. can chat_prompt_template and retrieval_chain be used for this project
3. How is the security ensured since there were already 5 documents inserted in vector store through decode.ipynbfile and 
- through streamlit another 5 docs were injected so how is the application performing seperation of documents.
4. since there were already some relevant docs inserted. can the data be received without ingesting the file in each session.
5. Modularise the codes
